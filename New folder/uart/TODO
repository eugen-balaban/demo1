Current TODO list is:

* Ability to shut down a UART after having used it, freeing the buffers
  allocated and shutting it down.
   
* Ability to temporarily suspend a UART to save power?

* Ability to toggle an RTS pin for RS485 half-duplex.

* Test more ATmega MCUs, especially with 2+ UARTs.

* Optimization of the ISRs to not do string based searches for every call.

* Add support for the ATxmega MCUs, especially with 4+ UARTs.
